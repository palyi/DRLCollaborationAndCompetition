<h2>Learning Algorithm</h2>
<p>
DDPG was adapted to train multiple agents. Though it is possible to get both agents use the same actor network to select actions, and add the experience to a shared replay buffer, I implemented two separate agents to see how this use case works. As a future idea, however, it is definitely worth trying to build the shared scenario.
